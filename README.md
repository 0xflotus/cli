> :snowflake: **S**elf-hosted **now** deployments 

Enjoy effortless deployments with a clone of [now][now] on a cloud of your choosing.

### Features
 - ‚ö°Ô∏è Deploy docker images via `snow` (or `snow deploy`)
 - üîí Auto-configured SSL
 - üîÉ Auto-scaling

### This is Magic üîÆ

No, it isn't. This CLI abstracts away the complexities of using [Kubernetes], [Traefik], [Kaniko], and a private [Docker Registry] together, replicating the functionality provided by `now`.

### Getting started

```
npm i -g @snowjs/cli

# Install CLI tools
snow install

# Create your kubernetes cluster (GCP)
snow create

# Create a DNS 'A' record (e.g., myapp.com A 1.2.3.4)

# Deploy your app 
snow
```

### Tell me more

Under the hood, `snow`'s simple CLI is served by a Kubernetes cluster. When you create your cluster via `snow`, we install [tiller][helm], which is used to install [traefik] as an [ingress object][ingress], which (1) automanages the SSL certificate lifecycle and (2) maps aliases to deployments. SSL terminiation occurs prior to requests reaching deployments.

When you create a deployment, your project must have `Dockerfile` and `now.json` files. The `now.json` file must specify both a `name` and  `files` array. On Kubernetes, an image is created from the Dockerfile, and pushed to a Docker registry, and deployed. Aliases from `now.json` will point to the deployment. If necessary, new SSL certificates will be created.

For your domain name to be resolvable by Kubernetes, you must create a DNS `A` record, which points to the IP Address of your [traefik] ingress.

The following CLI tools (installable via `snow install`) are necessary to orchestrate the entire end-to-end process, from Kubernetes cluster creation to managing your deployments:

- `kubectl` (for managing deployments, secrets)
- `helm` (for installing [tiller][helm] and [traefik] on your cluster)
- CLI tool for your cloud provider (e.g., `gcloud`).

If running Kubernetes locally on Minikube, you will additionally need these cli tools:

- `docker` (for running local registry)
- `minikube` (for running Kubernetes locally)
- `virtualbox` (for creating docker images)
